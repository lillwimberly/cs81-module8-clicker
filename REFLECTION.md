# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

Using the eventListener method and testing it. I called for it to console.log('button clicked!) when the click event was triggered. It was satisfying and helped solidify the concept for me.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?

They just came to me and I also took some inspiration from your suggested milestones prompts.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?

When I was trying to access the html elements from within the script tags - they were not working. I then had to dig and realized you used those methods on the document. So document.getElementById. Researching and figuring out the method names for accessing different aspects of the DOM to manipulate was new to me.

## What personal twist did you add?

Instead of changing the background on milestones, I decided to rotate through an array of colors and change the background every time the button was clicked. Additionally to add something to the final milestone, I added an alert to give the user a sense of accomplishment and to prompt them to give it a break.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

All online retailers use this functionality. Whether you press a button to increase the quantity or click to add it to a cart again. You click a button and expect to see a response change to the website based on your selection.
